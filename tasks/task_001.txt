# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with necessary configuration for a cloud-based, scalable architecture that supports real-time and batch processing.
# Details:
Create a new repository with appropriate structure for microservices architecture. Set up CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and Kubernetes for orchestration. Configure cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure) with necessary services for scalability and security. Initialize development, staging, and production environments. Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure.

# Test Strategy:
Verify infrastructure deployment scripts, test CI/CD pipeline functionality, validate environment isolation, and ensure monitoring tools are properly configured.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Repository with Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository with the appropriate folder structure for a microservices architecture, including service directories, shared libraries, infrastructure code, and documentation.
### Details:
Create a new repository in GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket. Set up main branches (main, develop). Initialize with README.md, .gitignore, and LICENSE files. Create folders for each microservice, shared libraries, infrastructure code (IaC), and documentation. Add initial configuration files like package.json, requirements.txt, or build.gradle depending on the tech stack.

Create a new repository in GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket. Set up main branches (main, develop). Initialize with README.md, .gitignore, and LICENSE files. Create folders for each microservice, shared libraries, infrastructure code (IaC), and documentation. Add initial configuration files like package.json, requirements.txt, or build.gradle depending on the tech stack.

Implementation Plan:
1. Review requirements for a microservices-ready repository and decide on folder structure (e.g., /services, /libs, /infra, /docs).
2. Initialize a new Git repository in the project root and add a remote (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
3. Create the following folders:
   - /services (for each microservice)
   - /libs (for shared libraries/utilities)
   - /infra (for infrastructure as code)
   - /docs (for documentation)
   Add placeholder files (e.g., .gitkeep) to ensure folders are tracked by Git.
4. Add initial configuration files:
   - README.md with project overview
   - .gitignore (Node.js template)
   - LICENSE file
   - package.json (for Node.js project)
5. Stage all files, commit with a descriptive message, and push to the remote repository.
6. Verify the structure and confirm all team members can access the repository.

This plan will be followed step by step and updated as progress is made.

The repository has been successfully initialized with a microservices-ready structure. The following components were implemented:

1. Created the core directory structure:
   - /services - For individual microservice implementations
   - /libs - For shared code and utilities across services
   - /infra - For infrastructure as code and deployment configurations
   - /docs - For project documentation and specifications

2. Added essential configuration files:
   - README.md with project overview and setup instructions
   - .gitignore configured for the project's technology stack
   - LICENSE file with appropriate licensing information
   - package.json with initial dependencies and scripts

3. Git repository setup:
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Made initial commit with all structure and configuration files
   - Verified that the repository structure is accessible to all team members

The repository structure is now complete and ready for the next phase of development, which involves containerization with Docker (subtask 1.2).

## 2. Configure Containerization with Docker [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up Docker configuration for all microservices, including Dockerfiles, docker-compose for local development, and container registry integration.
### Details:
Create Dockerfiles for each microservice with appropriate base images. Implement multi-stage builds for optimized production images. Create docker-compose.yml for local development environment. Set up container registry (Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, or ACR) and configure authentication. Document container build and run procedures.
<info added on 2025-05-06T17:02:36.540Z>
Docker containerization has been successfully implemented for the project. A sample service (services/api) was created with a properly configured Dockerfile that follows best practices. A docker-compose.yml file was added at the project root to orchestrate all services for local development, making it easy to spin up the entire environment with a single command. The build and run processes were thoroughly tested using Docker Compose to ensure all services can communicate properly. Comprehensive documentation was added to the README.md with clear instructions for developers on how to build, run, and extend the containerized services. The current setup provides a solid foundation that can be easily scaled as more microservices are added to the project. The containerization implementation is complete and ready for integration with CI/CD pipelines in the next subtask.

## 3. Implement CI/CD Pipelines [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment of the application to different environments.
### Details:
Configure CI/CD tool (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or CircleCI). Create pipeline stages for linting, testing, building, and deploying. Set up environment-specific configurations and secrets. Implement automated testing in the pipeline. Configure deployment strategies (blue/green, canary) for production. Set up approval gates for production deployments.

## 4. Provision Cloud Infrastructure with IaC [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, or Pulumi) for development, staging, and production environments.
### Details:
Choose and configure IaC tool (Terraform recommended). Create modules for network infrastructure, compute resources, databases, and storage. Implement environment-specific configurations. Set up state management for the IaC tool. Configure necessary cloud services: VPC/VNet, load balancers, managed Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS), databases, object storage, and IAM. Implement security best practices including encryption, network policies, and least privilege access.

## 5. Configure Monitoring and Logging Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions for observability across all environments and services.
### Details:
Set up centralized logging system (ELK Stack, CloudWatch, or Stackdriver). Configure log aggregation from all services. Implement monitoring system (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) with appropriate metrics collection. Create dashboards for key performance indicators. Set up alerting for critical issues with appropriate notification channels. Configure distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin) for request flow visualization. Implement health checks and readiness probes for all services.
