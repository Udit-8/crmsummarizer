# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop AI Summarization Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core AI engine to generate concise, accurate summaries of customer interactions from various channels.
# Details:
Integrate with NLP service (OpenAI GPT, Azure Language Understanding, etc.). Implement prompt engineering for effective summarization. Create channel-specific preprocessing for different interaction types. Develop post-processing to ensure consistent output format. Implement caching for efficiency. Create feedback loop for summary improvement. Add monitoring for AI service performance and costs.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for preprocessing and postprocessing, integration tests with sample conversations, human evaluation of summary quality, and performance/cost monitoring.
